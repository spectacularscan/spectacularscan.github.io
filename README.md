**Project Run: A Game For Pediatric Patients**
---
###     **Team Helios**

#### Glossary

- **Minigame** : The four different games (one for each scan) will be referred to as minigames. 
- **Subgame**: Activities that take place in each process that require user interaction. E.g. the spaceship game, cream rubbin’ game, injection game. 
- **Stage**: The different steps in each scan process. E.g. “Stage 1: patient lies on bed. Stage 2: patient is strapped in on sausages…”

#### Overview

- This application is a game meant to be played by children between the ages of 2 and 12 developed as part of our coursework entitled Project Run. This application's purpose is to prepare the users, the children for the eventual SPECT scan that they would undergo. The main aim was to show them the scanning process to help them both appreciate and understand what they would go through so that they would be less apprehensive and more willing to follow the instructions of the doctors who would perform the scan. 

- The game consists of four sub-games wth various stages depicting each part of the process for each of the different scans. The user will have to navigate through the scan and by doing this have a greater understanding of the scan when they eventually go through it.

### Functional Requirements

##### There should be **two game difficulties**, the subject matter will be the same but the way the player navigates through it will be different:

- Ages 2-4: This is the easier mode. The user interaction will be minimal. The sub-games will be easier/will not be included.
- Ages 4+: Will have more user interaction than the easier mode. For example, the user must apply a cream on a patient by moving their pointer around the area rather than just clicking on the cream. Sub-games will be a bit more difficult in this mode

For each of the two game modes above, there will be four minigames, one for each process the patient might have to go through. These are:

- MAG3
- DMSA
- Milk
- Meckel

### Non-functional requirements:
- **Accessible** – the game must be available on some website. The link to it should be all that’s needed to play. It should smoothly work on mobile, tablet or PC.
- **Child-friendly** – have characters that would be appealing to children. Use words that would not confuse/frighten them (sausage, donut). Keep words to a minimum, rely on pictures more.
- **Interactive/fun** – to keep the attention of young children, make sure the game always has something different for the player to do in each stage. Possibly have some more traditional games interspersed with the medical activities (like dodging things) to keep interest.
- **Educational/helpful** – this is the most important requirement. The purpose of this game is to help the child understand what will happen when they go to get their scan. If there is a child who is worried about getting their scan, they should be able to play the game, see that the patient left the room happy and unscathed, and hopefully be a bit more relaxed when they go in real life.

### Non-client ideas:
   Ideas for fun extra sub-games:
- **Spaceship game**: after an injection stage, the user will play a sub-game where they control a little spaceship (that represents the injected material) navigating through a bloodstream. They must avoid red blood cells on their way. **Hitting a blood cell will knock the spaceship back a bit. The game will end after 30 seconds or so, there is no lose state.**

### Other:
  Having a character other than a child as the patient in the game. Ideas:

- Superheroes that boys or girls will like (probably not)
- Cute animals (dinosaurs, monkeys, puppies or dog-men)
A television might be used during the scan to help the patient stay calm and distract them from what’s happening, and to keep them from getting bored and trying to get off the bed. We could show this in the game.
 
### Anything else:
- The machine is very quiet during the scan, so we can have it silent in the game.
- he doctors try to do the injection quickly (about 10 seconds) so it should not take too long in the game.
- Parent is always in the room with the child to help them stay calm. The child will often pick up on their parent’s attitude so they should stay relaxed too.
- After DMSA scan, the patient is told to stay away from other children and pregnant women for 24 hours while the radioactive material dies out
